#we will learn how to use input() in Python

input ("What is your name \n")
print("Nice meeting you "+ input ("What is your name \n") + "!")

#this is one easy way of doing it 
#the other way of doing it will be by introducting variables

name=input ("what is your name \n")
print("Nice meeting you "+ name + "!")
